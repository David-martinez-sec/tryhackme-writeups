## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform
- IP scanner / threat intelligence lookup
- Firewall configuration interface (simulated)

## 🔧 What I Did

- Reviewed the responsibilities of an SOC analyst, including log analysis, threat detection, and response coordination  
- Learned about the **4 stages of incident response**:
  1. Preparation
  2. Detection and analysis (via logs)
  3. Containment and eradication
  4. Post-breach recovery and review  
- Used a **SIEM tool** to investigate suspicious activity in system logs  
- Identified **unauthorized access** from an unknown IP  
- Ran an IP reputation check and confirmed it was malicious  
- Escalated the event to the SOC lead  
- Simulated blocking the IP via the firewall interface

## 🔑 Key Concepts

- SOC analysts are frontline defenders in detecting and responding to threats  
- SIEM platforms centralize logs for real-time analysis and investigation  
- The incident response lifecycle provides a structured approach to handling breaches  
- Collaboration and proper escalation are essential to effective incident containment

## ✍️ Personal Takeaways

This room helped me connect the dots between passive monitoring and active defense. I found it valuable to simulate a full incident—from detection to escalation and containment. Using a SIEM to trace malicious IP activity gave me insight into how critical logs are in threat detection. It also reinforced the importance of communication and structured workflows in a real SOC environment.
