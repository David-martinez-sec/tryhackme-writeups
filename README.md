# 🔐 TryHackMe Labs – Cybersecurity Walkthroughs

Welcome to my collection of concise, focused walkthroughs for rooms completed on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/). This repository documents my hands-on learning as I explore the core tools, workflows, and thinking patterns used in both offensive and defensive cybersecurity roles.

Each write-up includes:
- Room name and link
- Tools used
- Summary of what I did
- Key concepts learned
- Personal takeaways and reflections

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This repo serves as:
- A **personal learning journal** to reinforce what I practice
- A **public portfolio** to showcase cybersecurity skills to future employers
- A structured way to document progress across red team and blue team domains
