# TryHackMe: Linux Fundamentals

## 🧰 Tools & Concepts Explored
- Navigating the Linux file system
- Searching files and text (`find`, `grep`)
- Shell operators (`&`, `&&`, `>`, `>>`)
- Core Linux commands (`ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, etc.)

---

## 📘 What I Learned

### 🌍 Why Linux is so Commonplace
- Open-source and free to use.
- Highly customizable and efficient.
- Powers a huge percentage of web servers, embedded systems, and security tools.

---

### 💻 Interacting with a Linux Machine
- Logged into and interacted with a Linux environment.
- Practiced running commands in the terminal.

---

### 📂 Navigation & File System
- `ls` – List directory contents.
- `cd` – Change directories.
- `pwd` – Print working directory.
- `find` – Search for files in directories.
- `grep` – Search inside files for specific values or patterns.

---

### ⚙️ Shell Operators
- `&` – Run a process in the background.
- `&&` – Run multiple commands sequentially (only if the first succeeds).
- `>` – Redirect output to a file (overwrite).
- `>>` – Redirect output to a file (append).

---

## 📝 Recap
- Understood why Linux dominates modern computing.
- Interacted with a Linux machine for the first time in this module.
- Practiced **fundamental commands** for system interaction.
- Learned efficient ways to **search files and contents** with `find` and `grep`.
- Powered up commands with **shell operators**.
